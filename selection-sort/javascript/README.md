When wrote the first selection sort I was unware that the sorting algorithm was intended to be in place.

Grokking Algorithms completely skips this notion. After I did a little more research I found out that it's supposed to be in place, and my second iteration was in place and also ran faster than the first attempt.

The second attempt used a while loop with a little bit of state management. The 3rd attempt I'm going to use recursion and see if I like it more and see if somehow it performs better.
